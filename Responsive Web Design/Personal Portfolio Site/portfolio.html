        <h1>Technical</h1>
        <p>I have held a lifelong interest in technology. To give you an idea: I learned to read and write at the age of two by typing things into Google and seeing what came up. Below you'll find several examples of my experience in this industry.</p>
        <p> I am and always have been a techie, interested in tinkering with gadgets and seeing how they work. Having grown up using the creations of passionate software developers like Linus Torvalds, I am keen to become one myself and to create software that others will love.</p>

        <h1>Writing</h1>
        <p>I have had years of experience in the publishing industry. I have written about a variety of topics such as film and videogames, but mainly about technology.</p>
        <p>I am and always have written about being a techie, spreading the word about the most interesting gadgets I got my hands on. Having grown up using the creations of passionate software developers like Linus Torvalds, I am keen to spread the word about software that others will love.</p>

          <p>The publically-accessible articles I wrote during my 3-month internship at Codethink can be found either on <a href="https://www.codethink.co.uk/author/claudio-cambra.html" target="_blank">their blog</a> or on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudio-c-140760a1/" target="_blank">my LinkedIn.</a></p>
          <ul>
            <li>I was tasked with <em>writing articles on various complex technologies</em>, and subjects related to the software industry as a whole. <strong>Examples include articles on Fortran, Board Support Packages, FPGAs, Linux distributions, and more.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>These articles attracted the attention of online open-source development communities.</strong> In the 12 weeks following my arrival, the number of <strong>average monthly unique visitors to Codethink's blog more than doubled</strong> in respect to the prior 5 months of 2019. This stemmed from a significant growth in readers from developer communities on Reddit.</li>
